# Requirements and Specification
Rev. 1.0. `10/17/2020`  
Rev. 1.1. `10/31/2020`  
Rev. 1.2. `11/14/2020`

## Project Abstract<br />
**Foodify** is an all-in-one refrigerator management service. **Foodify** tracks the ingredients inside user's freezer, fridge, shelf and sends notification before the expire date. **Foodify** recommends recipes based on user's ingredients and preferences. **Foodify** provides an open community for the users. Users can easily follow the video & instructions on each recipe page, share their own recipe, comment on other's recipe.

## **Customer**<br />

* **General Customer**

  * Anyone who wants to manage the ingredients they own.
  
* **Specific Customer**
  * People who often fail to remember what's in their fridge and throw away lots of ingredients after expiration date
  * Cooking newbies who have no idea what to do with ingredients in their fridge
  * Cooking manias who want to get some new ideas about what to cook, or share their own recipes and cooking tips with others

## **Competitive Landscape**<br />  
Our main competitors are Beep, a barcode scanning service, and Yummly, a recipe recommendation service. We expect **Foodify** to be more competitive with respect to the following:

  * **Expiration date scanning through OCR**
    * Beep users must manually type in expiration date.
    * **Foodify** allows users to automatically scan expiration date through OCR. 
    
  * **Cusomized item units**
    * Beep cannot manage multiple products with same expiration date.
    * (O) Add (egg, expire: 1/1) (egg, expire: 1/4)
    * (X) Add (egg, expire: 1/1) (egg, expire: 1/1)
    * **Foodify** allows users to manage products in personalized unit.
    * (O) (egg, 2, unit: dozen)
    * (O) (egg, 4, unit: one)
    
  * **Personalized recipe recommendation based on my refrigerator**
    * Yummly does not consider the ingredients the user actually have.
    * **Foodify** recommends recipe based on both user's preference and the ingredients that user have.
